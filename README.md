# Customer Churn Prediction App

This is a **Customer Churn Prediction Web App** built with **Streamlit**, **Scikit-learn**, and **SMOTE**. The app allows users to input customer details and predicts whether the customer will churn or stay, using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## 📊 **About the Project**

Customer churn prediction is the process of predicting whether a customer will leave a service or stay. In this app, we use a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict customer churn based on various features like contract type, monthly charges, tenure, and more.

## 🧑‍💻 **Features**

- **Churn Prediction**: Predicts whether a customer will churn or stay based on input features.
- **Confidence Score**: Displays the model's confidence in the prediction.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with **Streamlit**, where users can input customer data to get the prediction.

## 🚀 **Technologies Used**

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web interface.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier).
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **imbalanced-learn**: For handling imbalanced datasets using SMOTE.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading the machine learning model.
